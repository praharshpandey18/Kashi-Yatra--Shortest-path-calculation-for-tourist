# KASHI-YATRA
Kashi Yatra is a C++ based project that calculates the shortest path between tourist destinations in Varanasi using Dijkstra's algorithm. The project leverages data structures like  graph,priority queue, array lists, and maps to efficiently manage and compute the shortest paths. This project includes features such as calculating the shortest distance from the user's current location to various tourist places and managing multiple routes and costs using nested hashmaps.

Key Features:

Shortest Path Calculation: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm with heap optimization to find the shortest path between any two places.
Distance Calculation: Displays the distance from the user's current location to a selected tourist destination.
Efficient Data Management: Utilizes priority queue, array lists, maps, and linked lists to handle data and compute paths.
Nested Hashmaps: Uses nested hashmaps to store and retrieve paths and costs efficiently.
